**1. Maharashtra before Shivaji**  
Shivaji Maharaj was a great man. We celebrate his birth anniversary with great pomp and reverence. It is a happy day for you children. You sing songs and ‘powadas’ in his honour. You garland his picture and say ‘Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai’. Who was this Shivaji Maharaj? What was the great work he did that we celebrate his birthday every year? The time in which Shivaji Maharaj lived was that of the medieval period. In those days, monarchy or the rule of kings prevailed everywhere. Many of the kings pursued their own pleasures and enjoyments instead of the welfare of their subjects. But even in those days, there were some kings who looked after the welfare of their subjects. The Moghul Emperor Akbar in the North and Emperor Krishnadevraya of Vijaynagar in the South are famous in history for their benevolent rule. Likewise, Shivaji Maharaj also commands great respect even today.

Shivaji Maharaj established Swaraj in Maharashtra. Swaraj means self-government, our own rule. For about four hundred years before Shivaji Maharaj, Maharashtra was not free. A large portion of it was under the rule of the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur. These two Sultans had divided Maharashtra among themselves. They were not liberal in their outlook. They oppressed the people over whom they ruled. They were also sworn enemies of each other. They constantly fought against each other with the result that the people suffered and were harassed. The people could not get enough to eat, nor could they celebrate their festivals or worship their gods openly and freely. They were not sure of safety even in their own homes. There was injustice everywhere. In Maharashtra, there were many Watandars like Deshmukhs and Deshpandes who owned Jagirs. They loved only their Jagirs and not their country. The constant fighting among them brought great misery to the people. There was misrule everywhere. People were tired of this oppression and were very unhappy.

Shivaji Maharaj saw all this. He undertook the noble task of establishing Swaraj in Maharashtra which would bring happiness to the people. He first brought to book the Watandars who fought among themselves. He then used them in his plan to establish Swaraj. He fought against the Powers that oppressed the people and defeated them. He established ‘Hindavi Swaraj’ based on justice, fair play and equal treatment to people of all castes and religions. Shivaji Maharaj made no distinction between Hindus and Muslims. He honoured the saints of all religions. We draw inspiration from these noble deeds of Maharaj. During a period of about three to four hundred years before Shivaji Maharaj, many saints were born in Maharashtra. Their work helped Shivaji Maharaj in his successful effort of establishing Swaraj. We shall see in the next chapter, what these saints did.

**Shri Chakradhar Swami:** Shri Chakradhar Swami was originally a prince from Gujarat. He became an ascetic and came over to Maharashtra. He moved all over Maharashtra preaching equality. He did not believe in any discrimination based on gender or caste. So, several men and women became his followers. The sect he established is known as ‘Mahanubhav’ sect. Memorable incidents from his life have been compiled in a book titled ‘Leelacharitra’.

**Sant Namdeo:** Sant Namdeo was a great devotee of Vitthal. He lived in the village Narasi. He composed numerous songs in praise of god, performed The tradition of Sants that began in Maharashtra with Shri Chakradhar, Sant Namdeo, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Chokha Mela was continued by Sants coming from various strata of society. In this group of Sants are included Sant Goroba, Sant Sawata, Sant Narhari, Sant Eknath, Sant Shaikh Mahammed, Sant Tukaram, Sant Niloba etc. Similarly, Sant Janabai, Sant Soyarabai, Sant Nirmalabai, Sant Muktabai, Sant Kanhopatra and Sant Bahinabai Shiurkar are also included. They taught people various virtues like compassion, non-violence, charity, service, equality and brotherhood. No one is inferior, no one is superior. All are equal. Such was the sentiment that was created by Sants in the minds of people. Similarly, Samarth Ramdas also rendered his work in Maharashtra.

**Sant Dnyaneshwar:** Sant Dnyaneshwar’s family belonged to Apegaon. Nivruttinath and Sopandeo were his brothers. Muktabai was his sister. Bigoted men of the time used to look down upon these children because they were the offspring of a ‘Sanyasi’. It happened like this. Their father took ‘Sanyas’ and retired from worldly life. As a Sanyasi, he left home. But later on, obeying the order of his guru, he returned home and started living with his wife. Their four children were born afterwards. The narrow-minded religious leaders did not think it right that a ‘Sanyasi’ should have children. People persecuted these children and banished them from their community. Once Dnyaneshwar went round the town begging for alms. But no one would give him any alms. He had to listen to abusive language instead. Young Dnyaneshwar was deeply pained by this incident. He entered his hut and locked the door from inside to grieve over his lot. Muktabai came and knocked at the door. She said, “Open the door, Dnyaneshwar. How can we remain drowned in our own sorrow? Who will then look to the welfare of the world?” These words of his sister gave new hope to Dnyaneshwar. He forgot his personal sorrow and started his work. Everywhere, the poor and backward people were being oppressed in the name of religion. Dnyaneshwar went among the people and taught them to have faith in God. ‘Give equal treatment to all. Help those in trouble and allay their misery.’ This was the gist of his advice to the people. Dnyaneshwar’s words are heard in every

 nook and corner of Maharashtra for the last seven hundred years.

**Sant Eknath:** Sant Eknath carried on the work started by Sant Namdeo and Sant Dnyaneshwar. He lived in Paithan. He preached that the way to reach God was through devotion - ‘Bhaktimarg’. He wrote numerous religious songs - ‘Abhangs’, ‘Owees’ and ‘Bharuds’. His advice to the people was not to accept any distinction of high and low. He made friends with the poor and the downtrodden and taught them devotion to God. His love extended even to the dumb animals. He exhorted the people to love all living beings and practised what he preached. One day he was going to the river Godavari for a bath. It was noon and very hot. The sand bed along the riverside was very hot too. He heard the crying of a poor child sitting on the hot sand. Eknath looked around and saw the child. He rushed to him and looked around for the child’s parents. He picked up the child in his arms, wiped his tears and reached him home. In this way, by his personal example, Eknath impressed the message of love and equality on the minds of the people.

**Sant Tukaram:** Two great saints, Tukaram and Ramdas lived in Shivaji’s time. Tukaram came from Dehu, near Pune. He owned a farm and also a grocery shop. His forefathers used to lend money to the needy people. But Sant Tukaram drowned in the river Indrayani, all the record of loan papers he had, thus giving relief to many. He would go to the neighbouring hill and sing songs in praise of God Vitthal. On the eleventh day, ‘ekadashi’ of the month of Ashadh and Kartik, he would go to Pandharpur. He wrote devotional songs - ‘Abhangs’ and performed ‘Keertans’. Thousands flocked to listen to him. Shivaji Maharaj also attended his Keertans. Sant Tukaram preached to the people about the virtues of pity, forgiveness and peace of mind. He also gave them the message of equality. ‘He alone is a saint, and God dwells with him who calls the weak and the downtrodden as his own’. He impressed this truth on the minds of the people. He made them think. People accepted him as a great religious leader and showered their praise on him. Even today, all over Maharashtra, we hear people proclaiming ‘Gyanba - Tukaram’ the names of the two great saints. Sant Dnyaneshwar is called ‘Gyanba’ also. Even today, ‘Tukaram Gatha’ is read in every household.

**Samarth Ramdas:** At the same time, the hills and valleys of Maharashtra were filled with the echoes of ‘Jai, Jai Raghuveer Samarth’ (Glory be to the great Rama) an invocation constantly on the lips of the great saint Ramdas. Ramdas was born at Jamb on the banks of the Godavari in Marathwada. His birthday falls on Ram-Navami, the day on which the great hero, Rama, was born. Narayan was his real name but he preferred to call himself Ramdas, the servant of Rama. Through his great book ‘Dasbodh’ he taught men the ways of good life. Through his ‘Manache Shlok’ (stanzas addressed to the mind) he gave people lessons in good thoughts and good conduct. To popularise the worship of strength, he raised the temples of Hanuman, the god of strength. He exhorted people to be strong and told them of the power that resides in a united people. He taught them to organize themselves and fight against injustice. This gave courage to the people. The work of the saints brought about a great awakening among the people. Religion once again became a thing to be respected and a spirit of self-reliance was born. People regained their lost confidence. This great awakening among the people brought about by the saints helped Shivaji in his fight for Swaraj.

**Maratha Sardars - The Famous House of the Bhonsales**

**Period of Unrest:** As the saints preached devotion to God, the brave Maratha Sardars started a tradition of bravery. This was a period of great unrest. The two Sultans, the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar were constantly at war with each other. They made use of the armies of Maratha Sardars in these wars.

**The Brave Maratha Sardars:** The Marathas were both brave and tough. They were also fearless and loyal to their masters. They were very proud of their achievements on the battlefield. The brave Maratha soldier with a spear in hand and a sword at the side would ride in his Sardar’s cavalry. All the Maratha Sardars had their own private armies. If such a Sardar went to the Sultan with his army, the Sultan gave him employment, made him a Sardar of his kingdom and sometimes conferred a Jagir upon him. The Sardar who received such a Jagir considered himself a Raja.

**Famous Maratha Sardars:** There were many famous Maratha Sardars at the Courts of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur. The more famous among them were the Jadhavs of Sindkhed, Nimbalkars of Phaltan, Ghorpades of Mudhol, Moreys of Javali, Bhonsales of Verul. The Sindkhed Jadhavs were descendants of the Yadavs of Devgiri. Jijabai, the mother of Shivaji Maharaj, was the daughter of Lakhujirao Jadhav of Sindkhed.

**Tradition of Valour:** All these Sardars were brave, but many of them were sworn enemies of one another. They never thought that they should unite and do something for their own people. So all their valour and bravery served the interests of others. Even so, they kept alive the warlike spirit, especially among the young. Many famous soldiers were born in their families who kept alive the tradition of valour. Among the famous families, the Bhonsales of Verul showed great bravery and enterprise.

**The Temple of Ghrushneshwar:** About four hundred years ago, the temple of Ghrushneshwar near the Verul caves was falling to pieces. The walls had developed cracks. The priest had also deserted the temple. Thus the temple, which was built in honour of a great god, was totally neglected. A great devotee of Shiva, Maloji Raje Bhonsale, visited the temple regularly. He carried out extensive repairs to the temple and restored it to its original condition.

**The Bhonsales of Verul:** Maloji Raje Bhonsale, the Patil of Verul, was a great devotee of Shiva. Babaji Raje had two sons, Maloji and Vithoji. Babaji Raje Bhonsale had the rights of a Patil in the Verul village. Maloji Raje and Vithoji Raje were both brave and enterprising. They had in their service many armed Maratha troops. It was a period of great unrest. The Moghul Emperor from Delhi had attacked the Kingdom of Nizamshah. Daulatabad was then the capital of Nizamshah. Malik Amber was his Vazir or Chief Minister. The two capable and brave brothers from Verul soon caught his attention. On his recommendation, the Shah conferred on Maloji Raje the Jagir of Pune and Supe Parganas.

So the Bhonsales became rich and powerful. Maloji Raje’s wife was Umabai. She came from the House of the Nimbalkars of Phaltan. They had two sons, Shahaji and Sharifji. Maloji Raje was killed in a battle at Indapur. At that time, Shahaji was only five years old. Then Vithoji Raje looked after the children and the Jagir. Later, he asked in marriage for Shahaji, the daughter of Lakhujirao Jadhav. Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhujirao, was well favoured by the gods. Lakhujirao accepted Vithoji Raje’s proposal. Lakhujirao was a brave and valiant Sardar in the court of Nizamshah. He kept a large army of his own. He commanded great respect and honour at the court of Nizamshah. He celebrated the wedding of Shahaji Raje and Jijabai with great pomp. Jijabai became the Fortune of the Bhonsale family.

**Shahaji Raje:** Nizamshah transferred to Shahaji Raje the Jagir he had conferred on Maloji Raje. Shahaji Raje was a brave and capable man held in great respect at the court of Nizamshah. The Moghul Emperor decided to conquer the Kingdom of Nizamshah. For this, he made an alliance with the Adilshah of Bijapur. Malik Amber and Shahaji Raje fought bravely to save Nizamshahi. They defeated both the armies. This battle took place at Bhatawadi near Ahmadnagar. Sharifji was killed in the battle. Shahaji Raje displayed great valour. He was praised everywhere as a brave General. His reputation in the court was so enhanced that even Malik Amber began to feel jealous of him. This gradually led to antagonism between them. As a result, Shahaji Raje left Nizamshahi and joined the court of Adilshah at Bijapur. Adilshah honoured him with the title of ‘Sar Lashkar’ (Chief of Army). Later, there were many developments in Nizamshahi. The Vazir Malik Amber died. His scheming son Fattekhan became the Vazir of Nizamshahi. During his period, the Nizamshahi began to decline. At about the same time, there was a threat of Moghul aggression. So, Nizamshah’s mother appealed to Shahaji Raje to return to Nizamshahi and save it. Therefore, Shahaji Raje left Adilshahi and returned to Nizamshahi.

Maharashtra was governed by four formidable powers: the Moghul Emperor of Delhi, Sultan Adilshah of Bijapur, the Portuguese of Goa, and the Siddi of Janjira, making any opposition seem futile. Despite these challenges, Shivaji remained resolute in his determination for self-rule.

**Torana Fort:**

Shivaji, recognizing the strategic importance of controlling forts, aimed to capture Torana, a renowned fort in the Kanad Valley. Situated southwest of Pune, Torana had two formidable "Machis," Zunjar Machi and Budhla Machi, providing strong defense. Neglected by Adilshah, the fort lacked adequate troops and ammunition, making it an ideal target for Shivaji's ambitions.

Shivaji prioritized duty over relations, as seen in his arrest and banishment of Sambhaji Mohite, a relative, for plotting against him.

**Chandrarao Morey of Javali:**

Chandrarao Morey of Javali, conferred the title 'Chandrarao' by Adilshah, became a significant adversary to Shivaji.

Shivaji realized the danger Yeshwantrao posed to Swaraj and decided to take action.

**'Rebel and you will die':**

Shivaji's attempt to reason with Yeshwantrao failed, leading to a confrontation.

Upon learning of Afzalkhan's advance, Shivaji realized the peril his Swaraj faced. Recognizing his inferiority in open battle, Shivaji, with Jijabai's blessings, relocated his headquarters from Rajgad to Pratapgad, seeking a strategic advantage.

**Afzalkhan's Counter-move:**

Afzalkhan's attempts to coax Shivaji into the plains failed, prompting him to adopt a friendlier approach. However, Shivaji saw through the facade and maneuvered to lure Afzalkhan to Pratapgad for a meeting.
